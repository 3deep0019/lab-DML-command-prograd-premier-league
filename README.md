Like the Indian Premier League (IPL) which happens during April & May every year. Our team organizes ProGrad Premier League at the same time for all the Cricketers in our team.

Practice Oracle SQL - DDL Statements.
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```
